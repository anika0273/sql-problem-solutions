# ðŸ›’ Walmart User Purchase Analysis (SQL)

## Problem Statement

Given a table of user transactions at Walmart, find each user's **most recent transaction date** and the **number of products they purchased** on that date.

## ðŸ§  Thought Process

I broke down the problem into clear steps to keep it intuitive:

1. **Rank transactions by recency** per user using `RANK()` window function.
2. **Filter** to only the most recent transaction per user.
3. **Count** how many products each user purchased in that transaction.
4. **Sort** the final output by transaction date and user ID.

> This solution is beginner-friendly and readable â€” no nested subqueries or complex joins.

## ðŸ§¾ SQL Query

```sql
WITH sort_date_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    transaction_date, user_id,
    RANK() OVER(
      PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date DESC
    ) AS recent_date
  FROM user_transactions
),

find_recent_date_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    transaction_date, user_id
  FROM sort_date_cte
  WHERE recent_date = 1
)

SELECT 
  transaction_date, user_id,
  COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
FROM find_recent_date_cte
GROUP BY user_id, transaction_date
ORDER BY transaction_date, user_id;
